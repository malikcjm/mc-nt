Version 3.0

This has been finished:

- Virtual File System: You now can browse tar, compressed tar and 
  file systems over the network as if they were local subdirectories;
- Slang support, you don't need ncurses anymore (but you can still compile
  with ncurses, if you want).

- Append option if you try to copy/move a file onto already existing one.
- Internal cd command uses CDPATH variable if set (like in BASH).

  criteria - actually spawns an external command and it can be find, awk,
  grep -l or anything else.

  are not working.

  input lines plus command completion on appropriate places of command

  information on the screen better.  Now you can also specify the starting
  mode for the viewer depending on the contents of the viewed file.

- Colors now let you specify the intensity of the colors you want.

This is being worked on:
- Virtual File System: FTP file system.

Version 2.0

Now users are able to define their own display 

- User defined display formats.

  Now you can configure the file display to suit your needs.
  For example, you can say which information you want to see displayed
  instead of our defaults.

- User definable program layout.

  Panels could be shown vertically or horizontally;
  panels could be different sizes, you can hide or show most
  program windows (command line, keybar or menubar).

- Output window.

  Now, it's possible to see part of the last program output on the Linux
  console without having to switch screens via an option in the layout
  menu.

- New View modes:

     Quick view: as you browse your files, each one is displayed on
                 the other panel on the idle time.

     Tree view:  let's you browse your directories by traveling a tree.  
		 We have two traveling modes available.  And the tree does
  		 not take your precious time: it's build on the fly, as you
                 browse your disk (you can always loose your time if you
		 want to :-).

     Info view:  Gives you information on the currently select file and
                 the current file system as you move.

     User view:  Let's you define a directory listing and the format you
                 want to use.

- New subshell support (concurrent shell execution)

  The Midnight Commander will now spawn one copy of the shell, so you
  get better performance and you can use shell functions, define variables
  and execute complete shell commands.  Supported shells: bash, zsh and
  tcsh.  If your shell is not supported, then the old mode is still
  available.

- Dialog box manager

  Almost all the new configuration options are configured with this
  new dialog manager, easy to use if you are familiar with dialog boxes
  in DOS and Windows. 

  Available widgets: check buttons, buttons, radio buttons, 
  input lines and list boxes (So you can take our code and use it on
  your applications).

- New option configuration.

  Now the program options are configured with a dialog box.

- Chmod and Chown commands:

  For changing permissions as well as ownership of files and
  directories, uses our new dialog manager.  

- Color customization support

  Now you can change the default color of the program with any of
  these:
  environment variable, Colors section in the init file (colors per 
  terminal type) and command line.

- User menu and extension enhancements:

  Execution understand the %t macro (tagged files). 

  User menu also has a new macro to let the user specify options.

  You can hide and show entries in the user menus by using conditions.

  Auto detect best match depending on a regexp.

- Viewer: 
     Goto line command,
     horizontal scrolling,
     on the fly uncompression (and we don't eat unneeded cycles of CPU),
     allow non gunzip operation.

- Internal move command:

  Now, we don't rely anymore on system commands in /bin, so the
  program is more robust and is much faster.  Bunchs of code come
  from the GNU fileutils.

- The Tree view and normal views allows wrapped incremental searchs of
  file names.

- Mask rename:

  Now it's possible to do things like rename *.pas in *.bak

- Compare directories command

- Allow panels to be in Long mode without forcing the user to a single panel.

  (You can even have two long panels).

- F10, C-g cancels as well as ESC ESC.

- Improved help system.
  
  We updated and spelled the help system and added a lots of links.
  The Web page is constructed with the same tools.

- Allows tagging of directories:

  Now you can copy, rename, move and delete complete directories.  You
  are not limited anymore to files.  

- View output (screen save/restore) on Linux console.

  On old Linux systems, only b&w is supported, on newer Linux systems
  (1.1.67 and newer), we also support color screen save/restore and
  cursos positions.

- 8 bit clean support.

- Visual feedback while i-searching files.

- Much more intuitive, you have to use it.

- It's better than aspirin.

- New memory allocation debugger.

  During testing time, we used a powerfull memory allocation debugger,
  so the program will not eat all your memory, and will make a good use of
  your memory.  

- Now it also runs on hppa-hp-hpux9, hppa-hp-hpux7, m68k-apple-aux and
  sparc-sun-netbsd1.0.  The best platform to run it is Linux, of course,
  since that's where most of us develop it.

- Inode sort option.

- Nice progress status indicator.

  We have two of them: a moving dash indicator and a progress bar
  indicator for file operations.

Version 0.15

- Mouse Support now also works on xterms.
   If you run in the Linux console, you will still need the gpm mouse server

   and can use the mouse support when using xterms.

- Help system and man page.
   Both were updated and has many more hypertext links inside, the
   help system can also be used with a mouse.
